**Learning:** Users migrating from heavy frameworks (Oh My Zsh) to native shell configs often miss the "visual context" (git branch, colors) more than the plugins. Providing a lightweight, native prompt closes this gap immediately without the performance bloat.
**Action:** When simplifying shell configs, always prioritize restoring context (pwd, git) in the prompt first.

**Learning:** A silent or black-and-white installation script feels broken or "cheap". Simple ANSI colors and emojis (✅, ℹ️) significantly increase user confidence during the bootstrap process.
**Action:** Always include a visual feedback layer (colors/emojis) in bootstrap scripts.
